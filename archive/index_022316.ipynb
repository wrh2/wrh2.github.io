      "Something I've been getting asked about a lot lately is hardware simulation in python. I had a recent article on the iOS backdoor and in it I did a bogus iOS device simulation just to illustrate a point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simulation was not really accurate in modeling hardware and I stated this. It was just about conveying what could potentially be done should an iOS backdoor exist. Naturally, I received questions/complaints about this. One of the questions was how would you simulate hardware in python? \n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is [MyHDL](http://myhdl.org). As a lover of the python programming language, I felt compelled to demonstrate its ability to simulate hardware using the MyHDL library. What I've put together below is a simple simulation for a 1-bit full-adder.\n",
