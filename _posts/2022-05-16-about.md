My name is Will. I'm a Computer Engineer that specializes in [Embedded Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) development. And welcome to my blog Bare Metal 0xaf!

## About Bare Metal 0xaf

Basically just a dorky name that I decided to give my blog that comes from spending a large chunk of my life playing with and developing electronics. There are all sorts of weird things we say in my field like [bit banging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging). And [bare metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine) is just another one of those weird things we say that refers to low level programming on an embedded system. The 0xaf is a hex pun, I guess, for [slang](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AF) all the cool kids use.

## About me

### What I do

I work on the electronics that perform dedicated function(s) within an electronic system.

It can get pretty complicated, but my work usually involves the design and development of

* System Architecture
* Communication Protocols
* Hardware
    * [Schematic Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematic_capture)
    * [Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)
* [Firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware)
* Testing
    * [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
    * PCB manufacturing (e.g. [Bed of nails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_of_nails_tester))
    * Assembly (e.g. End of line)

### What I've worked on

Here's a list of some projects and products that I've been involved with developing

* [Stack750™](https://powin.com/powin-announces-new-centipede-battery-energy-storage-platform/)
* [Trio™ Computing Workstation](https://www.capsahealthcare.com/product/trio-computing-workstations/)
* [NexsysADC™ Automated Dispensing Cabinet](https://www.capsahealthcare.com/product/nexsysadc-automated-dispensing-cabinet/)
* [OreSat0](https://www.pdx.edu/news/oregons-first-satellite-launched-orbit)
* [APDM Opal](https://apdm.com/wearable-sensors/)
* [VibroGait](https://apdm.com/apdm-engineers-help-design-device-to-alleviate-freezing-of-gait/)

### Published Work

Here's some published papers I've been involved with if you're in to that sort of thing.

* [Alleviating Freezing of Gait using phase-dependent tactile biofeedback - IEEE-EMBC 2016](http://wrh2.github.io/EMBC16_1023_FI.pdf)
* [Development of a Low-Cost, Open Software/Hardware Command, Control and Communications Module for CubeSats - AIAA SPACE 2016](http://wrh2.github.io/c3-aiaa-tech-paper.pdf)

### Education

* B.S. Computer Engineering, Portland State University 2016
    * Minor: Mathematics
