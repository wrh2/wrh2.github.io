Imported the old site over into an open-source jekyll theme that can be found [here](https://github.com/the-development/flex).
The import process was less than kind to me because I had been manually editing html automatically generated by ipython/jupyter nbconvert so everything kind of looks like crap right now.
Less crappy then before but still plenty of work to do.
I'll be working to clean it all up in the coming days but it'll be slow moving because I've got lots of other projects and such going on right now.

### A word about the move

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is widely used for blogs and there are a ton of open-source themes available.
I found mine [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes).
Jekyll offers some really nice functionality and is much easier on the eyes than what I had before which is why I made the move.
User-experience-wise it has been pretty easy to use so far and dealing with html has been minimal.
More on that possibly in a later post.
