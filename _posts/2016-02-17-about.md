My name is Will Harrington. I'm a Computer Engineer that specializes in embedded systems and this is my website. The current purpose of this website is to provide me with a platform for discussing things that relate to embedded systems, or whatever it is I feel like talking about, from the perspective of an engineer, but hopefully in a way that anyone (that can speak english) can understand and enjoy.
